# F2F Meeting in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, January 29-31, 2020

* **Meeting Location:** Microsoft offices, Evert van de Beekstraat 354, 1118 CZ Schiphol, The Netherlands ([see map](https://tinyurl.com/tp3whln))
* **Meeting Time:** 8:30 am to 6 pm (08:30 - 18:00) each day (tentative)
* **Breaks:** 10:30-11am, 1-2pm, 3:30-4pm (tentative)

Note on the site: although the Microsoft offices are not far from the main exit of the airport (which is also the exit if you take the train from downtown Amsterdam), there is currently major road work that could make walking to the Microsoft offices a challenge. Here is my advice: After exiting the hall, you will see a bus station. You can take bus 300 of the company R-Net, going to _the left as you come out of the hall_, in the direction of Haarlem. Take the bus one stop, get off at the station “Handelskade”. From there you can find the offices: Here is a a [zoomed map](https://tinyurl.com/udtx6hn) which also shows the bus stop. (The buses are large, red articulated buses. There are other lines as well, so be sure to use only the 300.)
