# F2F Meeting in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, January 29-31, 2020

* **Meeting Location:** Microsoft offices, Evert van de Beekstraat 354, 1118 CZ Schiphol, The Netherlands ([see map](https://tinyurl.com/tp3whln))
* **Meeting Time:** 8:30 am to 6 pm (08:30 - 18:00) each day (tentative)
* **Breaks:** 10:30-11am, 1-2pm, 3:30-4pm (tentative)

Note on the site: although the Microsoft offices are not far from the main exit hall of the airport (which is also the exit hall if you take the train from downtown Amsterdam) there are currently major road works that would make the walk to the offices a challenge. Here is my advise: exiting the hall you get to, essentially, a bus station. You may want to take the bus 300 of the company R-Net, going to _the left if you come out of the hall_ in direction of Haarlem. Take one stop, getting off at the station “Handelskade”. From there you can find the offices: I have made a [zoomed map](https://tinyurl.com/udtx6hn) which also shows the bus stop. (The buses are large, red articulated buses, but there are other lines as well, not only the 300.)
